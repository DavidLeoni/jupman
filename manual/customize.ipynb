So for versioning we think it's better to adopt a mixed git branch / tags devlopment model, and we added a template warning to show in old branches. To enable it in an old branch, just rename [_templates/breadcrumbs.html.bak](../_templates/breadcrumbs.html.bak) into `_templates/breadcrumbs.html` and edit as needed."
